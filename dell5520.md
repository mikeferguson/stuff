# Installing 18.04 on Dell Precision 5520

Left BIOS alone (secure boot enabled).

Did a regular install from USB installer. This gets you into a state where you get to grub shell, do:

```
grub> set root=(hd0,gpt5)
grub> linux /vmlinuz root=/dev/nvme0n1p5
grub> initrd /initrd.img
grub> boot
```

This will get you into working system. Now it is time to install proper version of Grub:

```
sudo su -
apt install --reinstall grub-efi-amd64 linux-generic linux-headers-generic
update-initramfs -c -k all
```

Reboot, hit F2 to enter setup. Remove old "grub" entry, make sure new "ubuntu" entry is above Windows.
